# Online_Signature_Verification
A novel method for online signature verification using 2-tire ensemble

In this method, we propose a 2-tire ensemble model for online signature verification. 3 types of features are initially extracted, namely physical,frequeny based and statistical. 

Ensemble-1 is applied to each of these 3 features individually. It consists of 7 classifiers. Normalised Distribution Summation framework has been used for this ensemble. So, basically we have 3 models one for each type of features.

Ensemble-2 is combines the 3 models of Ensemble-1. The ensemble strategy used here is Majority Voting.
